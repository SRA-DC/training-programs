= Political and Social Incidents
The variables involved in political unrest make it practically impossible to fully predict what you will have to do. That is why it is important to be prepared with multiple plans, including protecting your home, your community, and yourself. A neighborhood and community organized against unrest is infinitely stronger than an individual with an arsenal and fifty thousand cans of beans. Work with your community to alleviate shortages and medical problems, build the relationships that enable trust so that you can patrol together, fight together, eat together, and survive together. Even if it comes down to evacuation, a community evacuating in a planned and cautious manner has a far greater chance of making it together.
